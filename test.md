## 5. Lesson Flow
## Day 1
### Introduction (5 minutes)
*   **Objective:** Introduce the concept of algebra and its relevance to problem-solving.
*   **Activity:** Engage students with a real-world scenario: "Imagine you are selling mangoes at the market. You have some mangoes in your basket, and your mother gives you 5 more. Now you have 12 mangoes. How many mangoes did you start with?". Ask students to share how they would figure it out. This introduces the idea of an unknown quantity.
*   **Materials:** Real or pictures of mangoes, whiteboard.

### Mini-Lesson (15 minutes)
*   **Objective:** Define variables and constants, and introduce simple algebraic expressions.
*   **Activity:**
    *   Explain that algebra uses symbols (letters) to represent unknown quantities. This symbol is called a variable. In the mango example, the number of mangoes we started with is a variable.
    *   Define a constant as a number that doesn't change (e.g., the 5 mangoes given by mother).
    *   Write the mango problem as an algebraic expression on the whiteboard: "x + 5 = 12", where 'x' represents the unknown number of mangoes.
    *   Explain that this is a simple equation. We want to find out what 'x' equals.
    *   Simple practice: Ask students to identify the variable and the constant in simple expressions like "y + 3 = 8" and "a - 2 = 4".
*   **Materials:** Whiteboard, markers.

### Guided Practice (15 minutes)
*   **Objective:** Practice writing and solving simple algebraic equations using real-world examples.
*   **Activity:**
    *   Present a few more real-world problems related to Kenyan contexts:
        *   "You have some cows in your kraal, and you buy 3 more. Now you have 7 cows. Write this as an equation." (Solution: x + 3 = 7)
        *   "You had some shillings in your pocket, and you spent 4 shillings buying sweets. Now you have 2 shillings left. Write this as an equation." (Solution: x - 4 = 2)
    *   Guide students, step-by-step, to solve each equation by asking questions: "What do we need to do to find out what 'x' is?". Use manipulatives like small stones (representing shillings or cows) to demonstrate the process of isolating the variable. Explain the concept of 'undoing' the addition or subtraction to find the value of x.
    *   Encourage students to work together in pairs to solve the problems.
*   **Materials:** Whiteboard, markers, small stones or counters.

### Independent Practice (10 minutes)

*   Introduce Day 2's focus: representing quantities with variables and simple expressions. "Today, we're going to learn how to use variables to write down some math problems, like if we were counting mangoes at the market!" (2 minutes)

### Mini-Lesson (15 minutes)

*   **Concept:** Representing unknown quantities with letters.
*   **Example 1:** "Imagine Mama Wanjiku sells mangoes. We don't know how many mangoes she has today. Let's use the letter 'm' to stand for the number of mangoes Mama Wanjiku has. So, 'm' represents the number of mangoes." (3 minutes)
*   **Example 2:** "Now, suppose John buys 3 mangoes from Mama Wanjiku. How can we write that using 'm'? We can write 'm - 3', which means the number of mangoes Mama Wanjiku had *minus* 3." (5 minutes)
*   **Example 3:** "If Peter buys twice the number of mangoes John bought, how many mangoes did he buy?" Explain 2*3 = 6 mangoes. (4 minutes)
*   **Concept Check:** Ask students: "If a farmer has some chickens represented by 'c', and 2 chickens run away, how would we write that?" (3 minutes)

### Guided Practice (15 minutes)

*   **Activity 1:** Use algebra tiles to represent simple expressions. (5 minutes)
    *   Teacher models: "Let's say 'x' represents the number of goats a Maasai herder has. I'll use one tile to represent 'x'. If he gets two more goats, how would we represent that with tiles?" Add two unit tiles.
*   **Activity 2:** Work through examples on the whiteboard. (10 minutes)
    *   Problem 1: "A shopkeeper has an unknown number of oranges, represented by 'o'. He sells 5 oranges. Write an expression to show how many oranges he has left." (o - 5)
    *   Problem 2: "A student has 'p' pencils. Another student has 4 more pencils. Write an expression to show how many pencils the second student has." (p + 4)
    *   Encourage students to explain their reasoning.

### Independent Practice (10 minutes)

## Day 3
### Introduction (5 minutes)

*   Greet students and review Day 2’s lesson on identifying patterns.
*   Engage: Ask students, "Imagine you are sharing mangoes with your friends. If you have 5 mangoes and want to share them equally with *x* number of friends, how many mangoes does each friend get?". Briefly discuss that *x* is something we don't know yet, similar to algebra.

### Mini-Lesson (15 minutes)

*   **Concept: Introduction to Variables.** Explain that a variable is a letter or symbol that represents an unknown number.
*   Use Algebra Tiles (or drawings on the whiteboard) to visually represent variables. Let one tile represent *x* and other tiles represent numbers.
*   Kenya-Specific Example 1: If you have *k* number of cows and you sell 2, how many cows do you have left? Represent this as *k* - 2.
*   Kenya-Specific Example 2: If each child needs 3 bananas for a snack, and there are *c* children, how many bananas do you need? Represent this as 3 * c (or 3c).
*   Model solving simple equations like x + 1 = 3 using algebra tiles (if available) or visual representations on the whiteboard.

### Guided Practice (15 minutes)

*   Work through 2-3 problems together as a class on the whiteboard.
*   Problem 1: If a farmer plants *p* number of maize seeds and then finds 5 more, how many seeds does he have? (Answer: *p* + 5)
*   Problem 2: Amina has *b* beads and gives half to her friend. How many beads does she have left? (Answer: b/2 or b ÷ 2)
*   Problem 3: A shopkeeper has *t* tomatoes. He throws away 3 rotten tomatoes. How many tomatoes does he have left? (Answer: *t* - 3)
*   Call on different students to explain each step and reasoning. Encourage participation and peer teaching.

### Independent Practice (10 minutes)

*   Preview Day 4’s lesson: Combining Like Terms.
*   Homework (Optional): Assign 2-3 similar problems for students to practice at home from the textbook or online resources (https://www.khanacademy.org/algebra).

## Day 4
### Introduction (5 minutes)
*   Greeting and quick review of Day 3's lesson on variables (using the term 'unknown number') through a brief Q&A session.
*   "Yesterday, we learned about the letters we use to represent unknown numbers, like how many mangoes are in a basket we haven't opened yet. Today, we will start to use those unknown numbers in simple number sentences!"
*   Connect to real life: "Imagine you are going to buy sukuma wiki at the market. We know how much one bunch costs, but we don't know how many bunches we'll buy. That 'how many bunches' is our unknown today!"

### Mini-Lesson (15 minutes)
*   Introduce the concept of a simple equation: a number sentence that shows two things are equal.
*   Explain the equals sign (=) means "is the same as."
*   Focus on addition equations with one unknown. Example:  3 + x = 5 (3 plus a number equals 5)
*   Use Algebra Tiles: Represent the numbers with tiles. "We have 3 blue tiles and some other tiles (x) that together equal 5 blue tiles. How many more tiles do we need?"
*   Kenya Specific Example: "A farmer has 2 cows. He wants to have 7 cows in total. How many more cows does he need to buy? 2 + x = 7."
*   Write the equation on the whiteboard.
*   Solve for x by subtracting 3 from both sides visually using the algebra tiles (removing 3 tiles from each side of the equals sign).
*   Emphasize that x = 2. So the farmer needs to buy 5 more cows.
*   Repeat with another simple equation: x + 1 = 4 (using different objects like bananas).

### Guided Practice (15 minutes)
*   Work through 2-3 more addition equations as a class.
*   Write the equations on the whiteboard.
*   Use the Algebra Tiles as a class, allowing students to manipulate the tiles and verbally explain the steps to solve for the unknown (x).
*   Kenya Specific Examples:
    *   "You have x shillings. Your grandmother gives you 4 shillings. Now you have 9 shillings. How much did you have to start with? x + 4 = 9"
    *   "A shopkeeper has 6 packets of milk. He needs 10 packets. How many more packets does he need to order? 6 + x = 10"
*   Encourage students to explain their reasoning using terms like "equals," "unknown number," and "add."

### Independent Practice (10 minutes)
*   Students work individually on 3-4 similar addition equations from the "Algebra for Beginners" textbook (or a worksheet with similar problems).
*   Provide support to students who are struggling.
*   Circulate and observe student understanding.

### Assessment (3 minutes)
*   Collect the independent practice worksheets.
*   Quick verbal check: Ask students to explain how they solved one of the problems from their worksheet.

### Wrap-Up (2 minutes)
*   Review the key concepts: an equation uses an equals sign (=), and we can find the unknown number (x).
*   Preview the next lesson: "Tomorrow, we will learn more about how to find the unknown number when we subtract!"
*   Assign a small homework assignment: create 2 of their own simple addition equations using objects they see at home (e.g., pens, chairs).

## Day 5
## Introduction

(5 minutes)
*   **Objective:** To review the concept of variables and their representation in simple equations.
*   **Activity:** Begin by asking students what they remember about variables from the previous lesson. Use real-world examples relatable to Kenyan children, such as: “If ‘m’ represents the number of mangoes and you have 3 mangoes, what is ‘m’?”
*   **Materials:** Whiteboard, markers.

## Mini-Lesson

(15 minutes)
*   **Objective:** To introduce the concept of solving for a variable using addition and subtraction.
*   **Activity:**
    *   Explain that solving for a variable means finding its value.
    *   Demonstrate with a simple equation on the whiteboard: "x + 2 = 5".
    *   Explain that to find the value of 'x', we need to isolate it by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation. (Use Algebra Tiles to visualize this: represent 'x' and the numbers with tiles, and physically remove the same number of tiles from each side).
    *   Show the steps: x + 2 - 2 = 5 - 2, therefore x = 3.
    *   Repeat with a subtraction example: "y - 4 = 10". Explain that to isolate 'y', we add 4 to both sides.
    *   Kenya-specific example: "If Amina had some oranges (represented by ‘o’), and she gave away 3, and now she has 7 left, how many oranges did she start with?" (o - 3 = 7)
*   **Materials:** Whiteboard, markers, Algebra Tiles.

## Guided Practice

(15 minutes)
*   **Objective:** To practice solving simple equations under teacher guidance.
*   **Activity:**
    *   Divide students into small groups.
    *   Provide each group with a set of practice equations using addition and subtraction (e.g., a + 5 = 12, b - 2 = 8, c + 1 = 6, d - 3 = 5).
    *   Circulate around the classroom, providing assistance and clarifying any confusion. Encourage students to use Algebra Tiles if needed.
    *   Have groups share their solutions and explain their reasoning.
    *   Kenya-specific examples: "A farmer had some cows ('c'). He bought 2 more. Now he has 9 cows. How many cows did he start with?" (c + 2 = 9), "Fatuma collected some firewood ('f'). She used 4 pieces for cooking. Now she has 6 pieces left. How many pieces did she collect?" (f - 4 = 6).
*   **Materials:** Whiteboard, markers, Algebra Tiles, worksheets with practice problems.

## Independent Practice

*   Connect to Real Life: Discuss how variables help us in everyday situations. "Imagine you are buying mangoes at the market in Kisumu. Each mango costs 10 shillings. If you don't know how many mangoes you'll buy, we can use 'm' to represent the number of mangoes. The total cost would be 10 x m."

### Mini-Lesson (15 minutes)

*   Concept: Introduction to Algebraic Expressions. Explain that an algebraic expression is a combination of numbers, variables, and operations.
*   Examples:
    *   Write "2 + x" on the whiteboard. Explain: "This means 2 plus an unknown number 'x'."
    *   Write "3 x y" or "3y" on the whiteboard. Explain: "This means 3 times an unknown number 'y'."
    *   Write "a - 5" on the whiteboard. Explain: "This means an unknown number 'a' minus 5."
*   Using Algebra Tiles: Demonstrate how to represent simple expressions using algebra tiles. Let a small square represent '1' and a larger rectangle represent the variable 'x'. Show how "x + 2" can be visually represented with one rectangle and two small squares.
*   Kenya-Specific Example: "A farmer in Nyeri has some bags of potatoes, we can call this 'p'. He adds 5 more bags. Write an expression to show how many bags he has in total." (p + 5)

### Guided Practice (15 minutes)

*   Group Work: Divide the class into small groups.
*   Activity 1: Expression Creation. Give each group a set of scenarios. For example:
    *   Scenario 1: "You have 'b' number of beads and your friend gives you 3 more." (Answer: b + 3)
    *   Scenario 2: "You had 'c' number of cows and sold 2." (Answer: c - 2)
    *   Scenario 3: "Each student gets 'n' exercise books. There are 4 students." (Answer: 4n)
*   Activity 2: Tile Representation. Provide each group with algebra tiles. Write expressions on the board (e.g., x + 1, 2x + 3). Students use the tiles to represent the expressions.
*   Monitor and Assist: Circulate among the groups, providing guidance and answering questions. Ask probing questions like "How did you decide which tiles to use?" or "What does '2x' mean in terms of tiles?"

### Independent Practice (10 minutes)

*   Worksheet: Distribute a worksheet with problems similar to those practiced in the guided activity. The worksheet should have a mix of expression creation and tile representation problems.
    *   Example problems:
        *   Write an expression for: "A shopkeeper has 's' number of sodas and sells 6."
        *   Represent the expression "y + 4" using a drawing of algebra tiles (students don't need real tiles for this).
*   Differentiation: Provide a challenge problem for advanced students, such as "Write an expression for the total cost of 'm' mangoes at 15 shillings each plus a fixed transport cost of 20 shillings." (Answer: 15m + 20)

### Assessment (3 minutes)

*   Preview Next Lesson: Briefly mention that the next lesson will build on today's topic by simplifying algebraic expressions.
*   Homework: Assign reading from "Algebra for Beginners" related to algebraic expressions (specify page numbers). Encourage students to explore algebraic concepts using the provided online resources (https://www.khanacademy.org/algebra, https://www.example.com/algebra-resources).

## Day 8
### Introduction (5 minutes)

*   **Activity:** Review of Day 7’s concept of solving simple equations using a balancing scale analogy. Pose a quick oral quiz: "If 3 mangoes cost 60 shillings, how much does one mango cost?" (Connect to Kenya-specific context).
*   **Objective:** Recap the prior day’s learning and prepare students for building on that knowledge.

### Mini-Lesson (15 minutes)

*   **Topic:** Introduction to inequalities: representing ‘greater than’ and ‘less than’.
*   **Explanation:** Explain that inequalities are like equations but instead of equal signs, they use symbols like > (greater than) and < (less than). Relate this to real-life scenarios, e.g., "You need more than 50 shillings to buy a soda." Explain ≥ (greater than or equal to) and ≤ (less than or equal to).
*   **Visual Aid:** Use the Whiteboard to draw a number line and visually represent inequalities. E.g., "x > 3" is shown by an open circle at 3 and an arrow pointing to the right. Use Algebra Tiles to show that one side of the expression must have more or less than the other side.
*   **Kenya Example:** "To get a sweet from Mama Mboga, you need at least 10 shillings. Write this as an inequality." (x ≥ 10)

### Guided Practice (15 minutes)

*   **Activity 1:** Work through examples on the Whiteboard. Students suggest numbers that satisfy the inequalities. Example: "x < 7". Is 5 a solution? Is 8 a solution?
*   **Activity 2:** Use Algebra Tiles to represent simple inequalities, like "x + 2 > 5". Guide students to understand that the value of 'x' must be greater than 3.
*   **Differentiation:** For struggling students, provide simpler inequalities like "x > 1" with a number line already drawn. For advanced students, introduce two-step inequalities.

### Independent Practice (10 minutes)

*   **Task:** Students complete exercises from the textbook, "Algebra for Beginners", focused on writing and identifying solutions to inequalities. The exercises should be simple and directly related to the mini-lesson's examples. (e.g., "Write an inequality to represent 'You must be at least 10 years old to ride the roller coaster'.")
*   **Monitoring:** Circulate and provide support as needed.

### Assessment (3 minutes)

*   **Informal Assessment:** Quick show of hands: "Who can give me an example of something represented by ‘greater than’ in real life?" "What symbol do we use for 'less than or equal to'?" (Use responses to gauge understanding).

### Wrap-Up (2 minutes)

*   **Review:** Briefly recap the meaning of greater than, less than, greater than or equal to, and less than or equal to.
*   **Preview:** Announce that tomorrow's lesson will focus on solving simple inequalities.

## Day 9
### Introduction (5 minutes)
*   **Review (2 minutes):** Briefly recap yesterday's lesson on identifying variables and constants using examples from the Kenyan context, such as the number of mangoes a farmer harvests (variable) versus the number of trees they own (constant).
*   **Objective (3 minutes):** State the objective of today's lesson: "Today, we will learn how to simplify algebraic expressions by combining like terms, just like when we count similar types of fruits in a basket!"

### Mini-Lesson (15 minutes)
*   **Concept Explanation (7 minutes):** Define "like terms" using the Algebra Tiles. Explain that like terms have the same variable raised to the same power. Use visual examples on the whiteboard. For example, using tiles: 2x + 3x are like terms (show two 'x' tiles and three 'x' tiles). 2x + 3 are NOT like terms (show two 'x' tiles and three '1' tiles). Relate it to fruits: 2 mangoes + 3 mangoes are like terms, but 2 mangoes + 3 oranges are NOT.
*   **Modeling (5 minutes):** Model how to combine like terms using Algebra Tiles. Start with a simple expression like 2x + 3x. Physically combine the 'x' tiles to show that 2x + 3x = 5x. Then, demonstrate a more complex example, such as 4y + 2 + y + 1, rearranging the tiles to group like terms and simplify to 5y + 3.
*   **Kenya-Specific Example (3 minutes):** Present a word problem: "A shopkeeper has 3 crates of sodas (represented by 's') and then receives 2 more crates. How many crates of sodas does the shopkeeper have now?" Translate this into the algebraic expression 3s + 2s. Use the tiles or whiteboard to show that 3s + 2s = 5s.

### Guided Practice (15 minutes)
*   **Collaborative Problem Solving (10 minutes):** Divide students into small groups. Provide each group with pre-prepared cards containing algebraic expressions.
    Examples:
    *   5a + 2a
    *   3b + 4 + b
    *   2x + 5y + x
    *   4c + 2c + 1 + 3
    Each group works together, using Algebra Tiles if needed, to simplify the expressions. The students write their solutions on the whiteboard.
*   **Class Discussion (5 minutes):** Review the solutions from each group, addressing any misconceptions. Use a student friendly approach to address incorrect answers. Highlight correct solutions. Emphasize the importance of carefully identifying and combining like terms.

### Independent Practice (10 minutes)
*   **Worksheet Activity:** Distribute a worksheet with a variety of algebraic expressions to simplify. These should vary in difficulty. Include at least one word problem similar to the Kenya-specific example from the mini-lesson, but with different items, like sacks of maize (represented by 'm'). Encourage the use of Algebra Tiles for support, but promote independent work. Example questions:
    1. 6p + 3p = ?
    2. 2q + 7 + q = ?
    3.  Simplify: 5z + 2 + 3z + 1
    4. A farmer has 4 sacks of maize (m) and buys 3 more. How many sacks does he have now? Write the algebraic expression and simplify it.

### Assessment (3 minutes)
*   **Quick Check:** Collect the completed worksheets for review. Quickly observe student work during the independent practice activity to gauge understanding.

### Wrap-Up (2 minutes)
*   **Summary:** Reiterate the key concepts of the lesson: "Today, we learned about like terms and how to combine them to simplify algebraic expressions. Remember to look for terms with the same variables and exponents."
*   **Preview:** Briefly preview the next day's lesson: "Tomorrow, we will learn how to use these skills to solve simple equations."

## Day 10
### Introduction (5 minutes)

*   **Objective:** To review the concept of variables and algebraic expressions.
*   **Activity:** Start with a quick review game. Ask: "What does 'x' usually mean in algebra?" (Answer: It represents a number we don't know yet - a variable). "Can 'x' be anything?" (Answer: In this context, yes!).
*   Relate to Kenya: "Imagine we are counting mangoes in a basket. We don't know how many there are yet. We can use 'x' to represent the number of mangoes."

### Mini-Lesson (15 minutes)

*   **Objective:** To introduce the concept of solving simple equations using addition and subtraction.
*   **Activity:** Use algebra tiles to represent equations. For example: x + 2 = 5.
    *   Demonstrate how to isolate 'x' by subtracting 2 from both sides. Explain that to keep the equation balanced, we must do the same thing to both sides, just like balancing scales in the market.
    *   Write the steps on the whiteboard:
        *   x + 2 = 5
        *   x + 2 - 2 = 5 - 2
        *   x = 3
*   **Example:** "Let's say we have a plate of chapati. We know there are some chapati (x) and someone gives us 3 more. Now we have 7 chapati. How many did we start with?" (x + 3 = 7). Solve using the same method.

### Guided Practice (15 minutes)

*   **Objective:** To practice solving simple equations with teacher guidance.
*   **Activity:** Work through several example problems as a class, using both algebra tiles and written equations.
    *   Example 1: x - 4 = 10. (Imagine we have some sukuma wiki (x), we sell 4 bundles, and we are left with 10 bundles. How many did we start with?)
    *   Example 2: 6 + x = 9. (We have 6 oranges, and we add some more (x), and now we have 9 oranges.)
    *   Students work through the problems on their notebooks. Teacher circulates to provide assistance and correct any misconceptions. Encourage students to explain their thinking process.

### Independent Practice (10 minutes)

*   **Objective:** To allow students to practice solving simple equations independently.
*   **Activity:** Assign a set of problems from the "Algebra for Beginners" textbook or create a worksheet with similar problems.
    *   Examples:
        *   x + 5 = 12
        *   x - 2 = 8
        *   3 + x = 7
    *   Students work individually on these problems.

### Assessment (3 minutes)

*   **Objective:** To quickly assess student understanding of solving simple equations.
*   **Activity:** Quick exit ticket: Students solve one simple equation (e.g., x - 1 = 6) on a small piece of paper and hand it in as they leave. This provides a snapshot of their understanding.

### Wrap-Up (2 minutes)

*   **Objective:** To summarize the lesson and preview the next steps.
*   **Activity:** Review the main concepts covered during the lesson.
    *   "Today, we learned how to solve equations using addition and subtraction. Remember to keep the equation balanced!"
    *   "Next time, we will learn how to solve equations using multiplication and division!" Encourage students to explore the Khan Academy resources (https://www.khanacademy.org/algebra) related to solving equations before the next lesson.

## Day 11
### Introduction (5 minutes)

*   **Engage:** Begin by asking students a simple question: "Imagine you're buying mangoes at the market. If each mango costs 10 shillings, how much will 'x' mangoes cost?" (1 minute). Relate to their experience.
*   **Review:** Briefly review what a variable is and how it represents an unknown quantity (using examples from the previous day). (2 minutes)
*   **Objective:** State the learning objective for the day: "Today, we will learn how to write and simplify simple algebraic expressions using what we know about numbers and variables. We will practice using algebra tiles to help us visualize these expressions." (2 minutes)

### Mini-Lesson (15 minutes)

*   **Concept Introduction:** Explain what an algebraic expression is: a combination of numbers, variables, and operations (+, -, ×, ÷). (3 minutes)
*   **Kenya-Specific Example 1:** Present the example: "A farmer has 'y' cows. He buys 5 more cows. Write an expression to represent the total number of cows." Explain how 'y + 5' represents this. Use Algebra Tiles to model this. (5 minutes)
*   **Kenya-Specific Example 2:** Present the example: "Fatuma sells oranges. She sells 'z' oranges each day. How many oranges does she sell in 3 days?" Explain how '3z' represents this. Use Algebra Tiles to model this. Relate this to repeated addition (z + z + z). (5 minutes)
*   **Emphasis:** Explain the importance of combining like terms when possible (this concept will be revisited in more detail later, but introduce the basic idea). (2 minutes)

### Guided Practice (15 minutes)

*   **Activity 1 (Whiteboard):** Present the following problems on the whiteboard:
    1.  "A shopkeeper has 'p' potatoes. He sells 2 potatoes. Write an expression."
    2.  "A school has 'q' desks. Each classroom has 10 desks. How many classrooms are there?" (Requires them to think a little more about the relationship.)
    3.  "John has 'r' goats. Mary has twice as many goats as John. Write an expression for how many goats Mary has."
    Lead the students through solving each problem step-by-step, asking questions and encouraging them to explain their reasoning. Use Algebra Tiles where appropriate to visualize. (8 minutes)
*   **Activity 2 (Think-Pair-Share):** Present the following: "A matatu charges 's' shillings per kilometre. How much will it cost to travel 4 kilometres?" Have students think about the answer individually, then pair up to discuss, and finally share with the class. (7 minutes)

### Independent Practice (10 minutes)

*   **Worksheet:** Distribute a worksheet with similar problems involving writing algebraic expressions based on real-world scenarios, related to typical Kenyan experiences:
    1.  "A tailor has 't' metres of fabric. She uses 3 metres to make a shirt. Write an expression for the remaining fabric."
    2.  "A student scores 'u' marks in a test. He improves by 5 marks in the next test. Write an expression for his score in the second test."
    3.  "A farmer plants 'v' rows of maize. Each row has 8 plants. Write an expression for the total number of maize plants."
    4.  "A shop sells 'w' loaves of bread a day. How many loaves will they sell in a week?"
    Students work independently on the worksheet. (10 minutes)

### Assessment (3 minutes)

*   **Quick Check:** Collect the worksheets. Quickly scan the worksheets to identify students who are struggling with the concept. Note down the students who are having issues for one-on-one assistance the next day.

### Wrap-Up (2 minutes)

*   **Preview:** Mention what will be covered tomorrow: simplifying algebraic expressions with more complex examples. (1 minute)

## Day 12
### Introduction (5 minutes)

*   Greet students and review Day 11’s lesson on solving simple addition equations.
*   Engage: Ask students to share examples of when they've used addition in their daily lives (e.g., sharing sweets with friends, counting cows in the field). Relate this to using symbols to represent unknown quantities, like the number of cows they haven't counted yet.

### Mini-Lesson (15 minutes)

*   Topic: Introduction to Subtraction in Algebra - Solving for an Unknown.
*   Explain that today they will learn how to use subtraction to find a missing number represented by a letter (variable).
*   Write a simple equation on the board: x + 3 = 7. Explain that 'x' is the unknown, like a missing fruit on a mango tree. We need to figure out how many mangoes 'x' represents.
*   Demonstrate using Algebra Tiles:
    *   Represent 'x' with a single tile.
    *   Represent '+ 3' with 3 unit tiles.
    *   Represent '7' with 7 unit tiles.
    *   To isolate 'x', we need to remove the '+ 3'. How do we do this? We subtract 3 from both sides of the equation.
    *   Physically remove 3 unit tiles from each side. The remaining tiles on the side with 'x' represent the value of 'x'.
    *   Therefore, x = 4.
*   Kenya-Specific Example: If a farmer plants x maize seeds and after some time 3 seeds didn't germinate, and the farmer is left with 7 maize plants, how many seeds (x) did the farmer initially plant? The equation is x - 3 = 7.

### Guided Practice (15 minutes)

*   Work through two example problems together on the whiteboard, guiding students through each step.
    *   Problem 1: y - 2 = 5 (Represent this with Algebra Tiles if needed).
    *   Problem 2: z + 4 = 9
*   Ask questions throughout the process to check for understanding:
    *   What are we trying to find?
    *   What operation will help us isolate the variable?
    *   What must we do to *both* sides of the equation?
*   Encourage student participation by having them come up to the board and perform the steps.

### Independent Practice (10 minutes)

*   Students work independently on a worksheet with 3-4 problems similar to the guided practice problems.
    *   Example problems:
        *   a - 1 = 4
        *   b + 2 = 6
        *   c - 3 = 2
*   Students can use Algebra Tiles if needed.
*   Circulate the room to provide assistance and answer questions.

### Assessment (3 minutes)

*   Quick observation of student work during independent practice to assess understanding.

## Day 13
### Introduction (5 minutes)

*   **Review:** Briefly recap the previous day's lesson on inequalities (using Kenya-specific examples like comparing maize prices in different markets).
*   **Hook:** Ask: "Imagine you have a bag of mangoes (x). You know you have more than 5 mangoes but less than 10. How can we represent that using what we learned yesterday?".
*   **Objective:** State the day’s objective: “Today, we will continue working with inequalities, focusing on solving simple inequalities using addition and subtraction”.

### Mini-Lesson (15 minutes)

*   **Concept:** Define "solving" an inequality. Explain that solving an inequality means finding all the values that make the inequality true. Relate this to solving equations.
*   **Addition Property of Inequality:** Explain that adding the same number to both sides of an inequality does *not* change the inequality. Use number line visualization.
    *   Example: If x > 3, then x + 2 > 3 + 2.
    *   Kenya Specific Example: If the price of sukuma wiki (kales) in one market is more than Ksh. 10 per bunch, and transport costs increase by Ksh. 2, the price is still more than Ksh. 12.
*   **Subtraction Property of Inequality:** Explain that subtracting the same number from both sides of an inequality does *not* change the inequality. Use number line visualization.
    *   Example: If x + 5 < 10, then x + 5 - 5 < 10 - 5.
    *   Kenya Specific Example: A farmer’s maize yield is less than 50 bags. If 5 bags are lost to pests, the yield is still less than 45 bags.
*   **Model:** Work through 2-3 example problems on the whiteboard. Show all steps clearly.
    *   x + 3 > 7
    *   y - 2 < 4

### Guided Practice (15 minutes)

*   **Collaborative Problem Solving:** Divide students into small groups. Give each group 2-3 inequality problems to solve together, using algebra tiles (if available) to represent the variables and constants.
*   **Monitor & Assist:** Circulate around the classroom, observing student interactions, providing guidance and clarification as needed.
*   **Class Discussion:** Bring the class together and have each group share their solutions and explain their reasoning. Discuss any misconceptions.
    *   Examples:
        *   x - 5 > 2 (Farmer harvesting more than 2 bags after losing 5)
        *   y + 1 < 6 (Cost of exercise books less than Ksh. 6 after adding Ksh. 1 tax)

### Independent Practice (10 minutes)

*   **Worksheet:** Provide students with a worksheet containing 3-4 inequality problems to solve independently. Problems should be similar to those solved during guided practice.
*   **Resource:** Students can refer to their textbook and the online resources (https://www.khanacademy.org/algebra) if needed.

### Assessment (3 minutes)

*   **Quick Check:** Collect the independent practice worksheets. Briefly review for understanding of the core concepts. Use this to inform future instruction.
*   **Oral questions:** Ask one or two quick questions to gauge student understanding. For example: "What does it mean to solve an inequality?" or "How is solving an inequality similar to solving an equation?"

### Wrap-Up (2 minutes)

*   **Summary:** Briefly summarize the key concepts covered in the lesson: solving inequalities using addition and subtraction.
*   **Preview:** Tease the next lesson: "Tomorrow, we will learn about solving inequalities using multiplication and division."
*   **Homework:** Assign a few problems from the textbook (Algebra for Beginners) for homework to reinforce the concepts learned.

## Day 14
### Introduction (5 minutes)

*   Begin with a quick review of the previous day's lesson on inequalities. Ask students to recall the symbols used to represent inequalities (>, <, ≥, ≤).
*   Engage students with a real-world example related to science: "Imagine you are a farmer in Kisumu. You need at least 50 mangoes to sell at the market to make a profit. How can we represent this using algebra?" Introduce the concept of using variables to represent the unknown number of mangoes.

### Mini-Lesson (15 minutes)

*   **Concept:** Translating Word Problems into Inequalities.
*   Use the whiteboard to present various word problems.
*   Example 1: "A bus can carry at most 60 passengers from Nairobi to Mombasa." Guide students to identify the variable (number of passengers) and the inequality symbol (≤). Write the inequality: x ≤ 60.
*   Example 2: "To avoid a traffic fine, your speed on Thika Road must be less than 80 km/h." Guide students to write the inequality: s < 80 (where s = speed).
*   Use Algebra Tiles to visually represent simple inequalities (optional, if tiles are available and students are grasping the concept well). For example, x + 2 < 5 can be visualized with tiles representing x, positive numbers, and the inequality.
*   Refer to "Algebra for Beginners" textbook for additional examples (if available).

### Guided Practice (15 minutes)

*   Divide students into small groups (3-4 students per group).
*   Provide each group with a set of word problems related to Kenyan contexts and scientific scenarios.
    *   Problem 1: "A water tank needs at least 200 litres of water for irrigation during a dry season in Turkana." (Answer: w ≥ 200)
    *   Problem 2: "To pass a science test, you need more than 60 marks." (Answer: m > 60)
    *   Problem 3: "The maximum weight allowed on a bridge is 5 tons." (Answer: w ≤ 5, assuming w is measured in tons)
*   Instruct students to work together to translate the word problems into algebraic inequalities.
*   Circulate around the classroom to monitor student progress, provide guidance, and answer questions.
*   Have each group present their answers on the whiteboard and explain their reasoning. Facilitate class discussion and correct any misconceptions.

### Independent Practice (10 minutes)

*   Assign individual practice problems from the "Algebra for Beginners" textbook (if available) or a worksheet.
*   Examples:
    *   Write an inequality for: "You need to spend at least 500 Kenyan shillings on airtime."
    *   Write an inequality for: "The temperature should be below 30 degrees Celsius for a comfortable environment."
*   Students work individually on the assigned problems.

### Assessment (3 minutes)

*   Quick exit ticket: Students write down one thing they learned about translating word problems into inequalities.
*   Collect the independent practice sheets to assess individual understanding.

### Wrap-Up (2 minutes)

*   Preview the next day's lesson: solving simple inequalities.
*   Encourage students to explore online resources such as Khan Academy (https://www.khanacademy.org/algebra) for additional practice and examples.

## Day 15
### Introduction (5 minutes)

*   Greeting and brief review of previous day's lesson (Solving simple equations with one variable).
*   Engage students with a question: "Imagine you have a certain number of mangoes, and I give you 3 more, now you have 7. How many mangoes did you start with? Can we write this as an equation?" (Relate to Kenyan context: Mangoes are common and easily relatable).

### Mini-Lesson (15 minutes)

*   Introduction to inequalities: Explain the concepts of "greater than" (>), "less than" (<), "greater than or equal to" (≥), and "less than or equal to" (≤). Use visual aids on the Whiteboard.
*   Relate inequalities to real-life scenarios in Kenya: "The number of cows a farmer has must be greater than 5 to qualify for a government subsidy." (x > 5)
*   Demonstrate solving simple inequalities with one variable. Example: x + 2 < 5.  Explain that solving inequalities is similar to solving equations, but with a slight difference regarding multiplying or dividing by a negative number (briefly mention this concept; it will be explored more later).
*   Using Algebra Tiles: Demonstrate how to represent the inequality x + 1 > 3 and how to isolate the 'x' tile.

### Guided Practice (15 minutes)

*   Work through 2-3 examples of solving inequalities on the whiteboard, step-by-step, involving the students. Use examples like:
    *   y - 4 ≥ 2
    *   2 + z ≤ 6
    *   x + 1 > 4
*   Ask students to come to the board to solve parts of the problem. Encourage them to explain their reasoning.
*   Use examples relevant to a Kenyan context, such as "The number of shillings Peter spends on lunch must be less than or equal to 50." (x ≤ 50)
*   Have students use Algebra Tiles at their desks to visually represent and solve the inequalities being worked through on the board.

### Independent Practice (10 minutes)

*   Assign 3-4 simple inequality problems from the textbook (Algebra for Beginners) or create worksheets for students to solve individually. Example problems:
    *   a + 3 < 8
    *   b - 1 > 2
    *   c + 4 ≤ 7
    *   d - 2 ≥ 1
*   Circulate to provide assistance and monitor student understanding.

### Assessment (3 minutes)

*   Quick check: Ask students to raise their hands if they agree or disagree with a statement related to inequalities (e.g., "If x + 2 < 4, then x must be less than 2"). This helps quickly gauge understanding.

### Wrap-Up (2 minutes)

*   Review the main concepts covered: inequalities and their symbols.
*   Preview the next day's lesson: Solving more complex inequalities and representing inequalities on a number line.
*   Assign homework: A few more inequality problems from the textbook.

## Day 16
### Introduction (5 minutes)
*   Greet students and review the previous day's lesson on inequalities. Ask students to recall a real-life scenario where they encountered inequalities. (e.g., "We need at least 5 mangoes for the family.")
*   Briefly introduce the topic for the day: Solving Inequalities (Continuing from Day 15). Explain that today, we will be practicing solving problems with inequalities using the concepts we learned yesterday.

### Mini-Lesson (15 minutes)
*   Reiterate the rules for solving inequalities: adding/subtracting the same value from both sides, multiplying/dividing by a positive number maintains the inequality sign, multiplying/dividing by a negative number reverses the inequality sign.
*   Demonstrate solving a simple inequality problem on the whiteboard. Example: x + 3 < 7. Show the steps:
    *   Subtract 3 from both sides: x + 3 - 3 < 7 - 3
    *   Simplify: x < 4
    *   Explain that the solution means any number less than 4 will satisfy the inequality.
*   Introduce a slightly more complex example involving multiplication/division. Example: 2x > 10.
    *   Divide both sides by 2: 2x/2 > 10/2
    *   Simplify: x > 5
    *   Explain the solution and its meaning.
*   Introduce an example with a negative coefficient. Example: -x < 3
    *   Multiply both sides by -1 (and reverse the sign): (-1)*(-x) > (-1)*3
    *   Simplify: x > -3
    *   Emphasize the importance of flipping the inequality sign when multiplying or dividing by a negative number.
*   Use algebra tiles to visually represent these inequalities and solutions. If -x < 3, represent x with a negative tile and 3 with 3 positive tiles.

### Guided Practice (15 minutes)
*   Present a series of inequality problems on the whiteboard (3-4 problems).
    *   Problem 1: y - 5 > 2
    *   Problem 2: 3z ≤ 9
    *   Problem 3: -2a ≥ 6
    *   Problem 4: b + 4 < 1
*   Work through the first problem (y - 5 > 2) collaboratively with the class. Guide students to identify the operation needed to isolate the variable (adding 5 to both sides). Ask individual students to explain each step and its reasoning.
*   Have students work in pairs to solve the remaining problems. Circulate the classroom to provide support and answer questions. Encourage them to use algebra tiles if needed.
*   After 5-7 minutes, call on students to present their solutions on the whiteboard. Discuss any discrepancies and correct errors. Encourage students to explain their reasoning.

### Independent Practice (10 minutes)
*   Provide students with a worksheet containing 3-4 inequality problems similar to those practiced during the guided practice. Include problems with different operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and negative coefficients).
    *   Worksheet example:
        1.  p + 2 ≤ 6
        2.  4q > 12
        3.  -3r < 9
        4.  s - 7 ≥ -2
*   Instruct students to solve the problems individually. Monitor their progress and provide assistance as needed.

### Assessment (3 minutes)
*   Collect the independent practice worksheets. Quickly review the answers to identify students who may need additional support.

### Wrap-Up (2 minutes)
*   Summarize the key concepts learned during the lesson. Emphasize the importance of remembering to flip the inequality sign when multiplying or dividing by a negative number.
*   Briefly introduce the topic for the next day: Graphing Inequalities on a Number Line.
*   Assign a short review exercise from the textbook ("Algebra for Beginners") related to solving inequalities.

## Day 17
### Introduction (5 minutes)

### Mini-Lesson (15 minutes)
*   **Topic: Applying Algebra to Real-World Problems in Science**
*   **Introduction:** Explain how algebra can be used to solve real-world problems, especially in science.
*   **Example 1: Plant Growth:** "Imagine we are growing beans in the school garden. We know each bean plant grows 'x' cm each day. If we want the plant to be 20 cm tall after 5 days, how many cm does it need to grow each day? (5x = 20)". Use Algebra Tiles to visualize the equation.
*   **Example 2: Distance and Time:** "If a boda-boda travels at a speed of 30 km per hour ('k' km/h) to reach a market that is 'd' km away. If it takes him 2 hours to reach the market, how far away is the market? (d = 30 * 2)". Draw a simple visual representation on the Whiteboard.
*   **Explanation:** Define the variables and how to translate word problems into algebraic equations. Explain the importance of units (cm, km, hours).

### Guided Practice (15 minutes)
*   **Group Activity:** Divide the class into small groups (4-5 students per group).
*   **Problem 1:** "A farmer in Kenya has 'y' cows. Each cow gives 5 liters of milk per day. If the farmer gets a total of 35 liters of milk each day, how many cows does the farmer have? (5y = 35)". Guide students through solving the equation using Algebra Tiles and the Whiteboard for collaborative work.
*   **Problem 2:** "If one kilogram of maize flour costs 'm' shillings. You have 100 shillings and you buy 2 kgs of flour. How much does one kilogram of maize flour cost? (2m = 100)". Encourage groups to discuss their approach and arrive at a solution. Monitor each group, providing assistance and feedback as needed.

## Day 20
### Introduction (5 minutes)
Engage students with a quick review game. Ask questions related to yesterday's lesson on inequalities (e.g., "What does '<' mean?" "Give an example of an inequality."). Relate inequalities to real-life scenarios: "Imagine a farmer in Kenya needs at least 10 bags of maize for his family. Can he have less than 10 bags?"

### Mini-Lesson (15 minutes)
Today's focus: Applying inequalities to solve real-world problems.
Review the process of solving inequalities, emphasizing that multiplying or dividing by a negative number flips the inequality sign. Use Algebra Tiles to visualize these operations.
Example problem: "A farmer wants to sell mangoes at the market. He needs to make at least 500 Kenyan Shillings to cover his costs. Each mango sells for 20 Shillings. How many mangoes does he need to sell?"
Write the inequality: 20x ≥ 500.
Walk through the steps to solve for x: x ≥ 25. Explain what this means in the context of the problem (he needs to sell at least 25 mangoes). Demonstrate with graphing calculator visualizing the inequality on a number line.

### Guided Practice (15 minutes)
Present two more real-world problems related to the Kenyan context:
1.  "A school wants to buy textbooks. They have 10,000 Kenyan Shillings. Each textbook costs 350 Shillings. How many textbooks can they buy?" (Inequality: 350x ≤ 10000)
2.  "A baker wants to bake at least 100 mandazis for a fundraiser. She already baked 45. How many more mandazis does she need to bake?" (Inequality: 45 + x ≥ 100)
Work through these problems on the whiteboard, engaging students in each step. Ask guiding questions: "What is the variable representing?", "What operation do we need to do to isolate the variable?", "What does the solution mean in the context of the problem?". Have students use Algebra Tiles to represent each side of the inequality.

### Independent Practice (10 minutes)
Provide students with 3-4 similar problems to solve independently using materials.
Examples:
1. A child wants to buy sweets. Each sweet costs 15 Kenyan Shillings. He has 200 Kenyan Shillings. How many sweets can he buy?
2. A soccer team needs to score at least 5 goals to win. They have already scored 2 goals. How many more goals do they need?
3. A student wants to save at least 1,500 Kenyan Shillings for a school trip. He saves 75 Shillings each week. For how many weeks must he save?

### Assessment (3 minutes)
Quick exit ticket: Present a simple word problem requiring the setting up and solving of an inequality. Example: "You have 50 Kenyan Shillings. You want to buy bananas that cost 8 Kenyan Shillings each. How many bananas can you buy?" Students write down the inequality and the solution.

### Wrap-Up (2 minutes)
Review the key concepts of the day – applying inequalities to real-world problems. Briefly discuss any common errors observed in the exit tickets. Assign optional homework: Students find one real-world scenario from their home or community that can be represented by an inequality and solve it. Suggest they use the online resources (https://www.khanacademy.org/algebra, https://www.example.com/algebra-resources) and Textbook: Algebra for Beginners for further exploration.

## Extension/Enrichment

### Exploring Variables Through Art & Nature

Students will create nature collages or drawings where different natural objects (leaves, twigs, stones) represent variables. They will then write simple "equations" describing the collage. For example:

*   Let L = Leaves, S = Stones, T = Twigs.
*   If a collage has 3 Leaves, 2 Stones and 1 Twig, the equation could be: L + L + L + S + S + T = Collage.

This activity links abstract variables to tangible objects, encouraging visual learners.

### Building Equations with Blocks & Measurement

Students will use blocks of varying sizes to represent different variables. They will then use a ruler to measure the total length of different combinations of blocks. This leads to understanding equations based on physical quantities.

*   Small block = x, Medium block = y.
*   Measure x, measure y. What is the length of x + y? What is the length of x + x + y?
*   Relate the length measurement to solving for an unknown.

### Investigating Inequalities Through Weight & Balance

Using a balance scale and various objects (erasers, paper clips, coins), students will explore the concept of inequalities.

*   They will predict whether one set of objects will be heavier, lighter, or equal in weight to another set.
*   Represent the heavier side with ">", the lighter side with "<", and equal weight with "=".
*   Examples: 3 Erasers > 5 Paperclips? Test and record the results as an inequality. Introduce simple variables to represent the items.
*   x = Eraser, y = Paperclip. 3x > 5y (Can be a real or false statement based on physical measurement.)

These projects are designed to be hands-on and interdisciplinary, connecting algebraic concepts to art, measurement, and physical science in engaging ways. They promote critical thinking, problem-solving, and a deeper understanding of the core algebraic concepts.

## Assessment Tools

### Quizzes
Several quizzes will be administered throughout the 20-day lesson to assess understanding of algebraic expressions, solving linear equations, and applying algebra to real-world problems. Students must score at least 70% on each quiz to pass. Quizzes will include multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, and short-answer questions related to the key concepts of variables, equations, and inequalities.

### Project: Real-World Algebra Application
Students will complete a project where they apply algebraic concepts to solve a real-world problem related to science. This project will require students to identify a problem, create an algebraic model, solve the model, and present their findings. The project aims to assess students' ability to connect algebraic principles to practical applications and demonstrate their problem-solving skills.

(Use or adapt examples from http://www.softschools.com/math/subtraction/picture_subtraction_worksheets/picture_subtraction_worksheets.html, making sure to change to addition problems)
*   Students work independently to solve the problems.
*   Teacher circulates to provide assistance as needed.

### Assessment (3 minutes)

*   **Quick Check:** Ask a few students to share their answers from the independent practice worksheet.
*   **Observation:** Observe students' engagement and participation during the guided and independent practice activities. Note any students who are struggling.

### Wrap-Up (2 minutes)

*   **Review:** Briefly recap the key concepts learned today (simple addition).
*   **Preview:** Tell students what they will be learning in the next lesson (more addition problems, maybe introducing zero).
*   **Positive Reinforcement:** Praise the students for their hard work and participation. "Aaj aap sab ne bahut achcha kaam kiya!" (You all did very well today!).

## Extension/Enrichment Activities

### Numbers and Operations & Plant Life Cycles
Students plant seeds and track their growth using numbers. They can measure the height of the plant daily/weekly and record the data. Extension: Compare growth rates of different plants, practicing subtraction to find the difference.

### Algebra & Weather Patterns
Students observe and record daily weather patterns using symbols (sun, cloud, rain). They can create simple equations to represent the frequency of each weather type over a week (e.g., Sunny days + Cloudy days = Total days). This links algebraic thinking to a real-world science phenomenon.

### Geometry and Measurement & Building Structures
Students use geometric shapes (blocks, paper cutouts) to build structures (houses, bridges). They can measure the length, width, and height of their structures, estimating and then verifying with rulers. Explore stability based on shape.

### Data Handling & Animal Observations
Students observe different animals (real or pictures) and collect data about their characteristics (e.g., number of legs, color, size). They create simple bar graphs or pictographs to represent the data and draw conclusions (e.g., "Most animals have four legs").

### Reasoning and Logical Thinking & Sorting Leaves
Collect different types of leaves. Students sort the leaves based on various characteristics (color, size, shape, texture). They use logical reasoning to explain their sorting criteria and justify their groupings.

### Fractions & Sharing Food
Students use real-world objects like fruits or snacks to understand fractions. They can divide an apple into halves, quarters, or thirds to share with friends, relating fractions to concrete objects.

### Decimals & Measuring Rainfall
Set up a simple rain gauge and measure daily rainfall in millimeters. Students learn to record and compare rainfall amounts using decimals (e.g., 0.5 mm, 1.2 mm). Relate this to the water cycle.

### Patterns & Nature Sequences
Students create patterns using natural objects like stones, leaves, flowers, and shells. They identify the repeating unit in the pattern and extend it. This reinforces the concept of patterns in a visual and tactile way, and makes connections to observing pattern in nature.

### HCF & LCM (Simplified Introduction - Grouping) & Seed Distribution
Present a simplified version of grouping. Students are given sets of seeds and asked to group them into equal groups, looking for the largest possible group size (related to HCF). They can also explore how many different ways they can create equal sized sets (related to LCM).
